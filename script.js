    <h4>AI-Based 6G Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces – Senior Design</h4>
    <p>This senior design project focuses on using AI to dynamically control Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) for next-generation wireless communication. RIS are smart surfaces made of tiny antennas that can be adjusted to reflect wireless signals in useful directions to improve coverage. Our work was primarily simulation-based, using ray-tracing and AI to test how RIS can reduce dead zones and boost signal strength. As the Machine Learning Engineer on the team, I led the development of a reinforcement learning system that optimizes RIS configuration to enhance signal power and mitigate wireless dead zones in complex indoor environments.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Generated simulation data and automated experiments using Python scripts in Wireless InSite across a range of RIS angles (−170° to 170°) and receiver coordinates</li>
    <li>Built and trained a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning model to predict the optimal reflection angle based on receiver location and signal feedback</li>
    <li>Designed a custom reward function and implemented state encoding and policy exploration strategies. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on how well the chosen angle improves received signal power; the reward function is directly based on power levels</li>
    <li>Achieved strong model performance (MAE: 5.3°, R²: 0.979), outperforming baseline models such as Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
    <li>Deployed the model on a Google Coral Edge TPU for efficient, real-time inference in a low-power edge environment</li>
    <li>Currently working on deploying the trained model into the DragonRadio SDR setup to evaluate real-time RIS configuration impact on channel quality and signal performance</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was supported by the National Science Foundation and conducted in partnership with Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory (DWSL). It combines AI, embedded systems, and radio-frequency engineering into a scalable prototype for smart indoor connectivity in 6G networks.</p>

    <h4>Computer Systems & Architecture</h4>
    <p>As part of Drexel University's Computer Organization course, I completed a series of hands-on projects exploring the inner workings of modern computer systems. These projects covered key topics including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digital Logic Design:</strong> Created and simulated adder circuits and counters to understand the foundations of digital electronics.</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Designed an ALU to perform arithmetic and logical operations, reinforcing core processor functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Systems:</strong> Designed and simulated RAM modules with dynamic read/write logic and address decoding.</li>
        <li><strong>Hack Computer Architecture:</strong> Simulated the Hack computer (a minimalist hardware model) to explore how CPUs, memory, and control logic interact to execute machine-level instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Assembler Implementation:</strong> Built an assembler that translates Hack assembly instructions into binary machine code.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Machine Translator:</strong> Developed a two-part VM translator to convert high-level stack-based commands into Hack assembly, including support for memory segments, arithmetic, branching, and function calls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Through these projects, I gained a deep understanding of how computers operate at the hardware level. I built skills in low-level programming (assembly language), digital logic simulation, virtual machine architecture, memory management, and compiler/interpreter design using Python.</p>
